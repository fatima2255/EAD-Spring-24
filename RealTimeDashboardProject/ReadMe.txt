Breif Description of the project: 
Title of project: Real-time Data Fetching and Processing: Implement a dashboard that fetches data from an API in real-time and uses Web Workers to process this data before displaying it. This could involve aggregating data, performing calculations, or filtering results based on user input.

A simple project is created that has three files ie. index.html, dataworker.js and dashboard.js. The dashboard file has the main thread that directs the worker to fetch data from an api (An online api climate change data is used in this project) and organises the data, being fetched, in columns. Two columns are displayed ie time and temperature_2m.
